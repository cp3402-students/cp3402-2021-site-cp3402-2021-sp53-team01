After we already host the website, the user that will take over the website can simply click the link to the hosted website that we created. Then, on the above URL, the user can type in /wp-admin to switch the webpage to the admin login page. There, the client can type in the necessary username and password that will be provided by us to enter the dashboard of the Wordpress page. Then, the user can easily go to pages and edit the existing pages and update the pages, or can add in new pages to the website by basically clicking the add new button provided by Wordpress. This is how the user can modify or add new pages on Wordpress.
