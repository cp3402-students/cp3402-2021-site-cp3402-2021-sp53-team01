The Fast Food Heaven theme is based on the classic white and wheat color theme which represents a cool and calm look for the users. The reason for using the white background instead of any other color for our webiste is beacause white color background makes our website looks more professional. The reason for using a wheat color theme is because it makes our content shine brighter. So in order to change the header and footer color of our website the new developer would have to go into FastFoodHeavenTheme, then assets, then css and then change the code inside global.min.css to change and modify the color. The main features of our themes are the header and footer where the header also consist of a nicely set up navigation bar.
