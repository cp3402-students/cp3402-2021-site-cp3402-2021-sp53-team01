The way we deployed our website took several steps and I will be describing each and every step. First, we bought a Domain name for our website. Then, we register the amazon aws account. Thirdly, we set up the server on aws. Then, we set up the Wordpress on that server. This will help us edit the pages. Then, we set up the elastic ip address of that server. Then, we deployed our website content onto the Wordpress site. This will make our website looks real with real content. Then, we register the domain name on a DNS website. Last of all, we set the domain name to our website on the aws server. These are all the steps needed to deploy our website. If the user wants to test on his local server, he can simply clone the repo and commit after making changes. And the rest of the users can pull it to the origin and see the changes.
