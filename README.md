      ```

   - Install some vs code plugins (optional) and reboot vscode after installation.
   - After installation, you need to add some configuration for different pairs of plugins, which is configured in vscode's setting.json.
   - Run wp rig (first, make sure the VPN is turned on):
     The first time it is run, on the vscode command line: npm run rig-init
     If there is already a dependency locally, you need to update the node dependency, enter: npm install
     Run the project: npm run dev About a few minutes, the project will run up and automatically open the page.
   - If you enter the background and find that the stitching /wp-admin cannot be opened, run npm run generateCert to install the certificate.
